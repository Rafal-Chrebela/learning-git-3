                        <p>
                            Is this the real life? 
                            Is this just fantasy? 
                            Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. 
                            Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. 
                            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, 
                            Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.
                            Anyway the wind blows
                            Doesn't really matter to me, to me.

                            Mama just killed a man
                            Put a gun against his head 
                            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead. 
                            Mama, life had just begun
                            But now I've gone and thrown it all away. 
                            Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry, 
                            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, 
                            Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.

                            Too late, my time has come
                            Sends shivers down my spine
                           Body's aching all the time. 
                            Good bye, everybody, I've got to go
                            Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
